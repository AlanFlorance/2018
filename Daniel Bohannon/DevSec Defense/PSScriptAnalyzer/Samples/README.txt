The PowerShell scripts in this directory are taken from the PowerShell corpus of 408K+ scripts assembled by Daniel Bohannon (@danielhbohannon) and Lee Holmes (@Lee_Holmes) from public sources during the Revoke-Obfuscation research. This full corpus can be downloaded from https://aka.ms/PowerShellCorpus.

The scripts in these directories were NOT written by Daniel Bohannon. As such, the author (Daniel Bohannon) does not assume responsiblity if the user executes these scripts. Most notably, the scripts located in the InvokeCradleCrafter directory were generated with the Invoke-CradleCrafter framework with actual malicious URLs taken from public malware lists for more realistic character frequency training during the Revoke-Obfuscation research, so it is definitely not advised to run any scripts in this directory.
